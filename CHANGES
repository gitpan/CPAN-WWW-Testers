        - consumed many patches from Gabor Szabo
        - RT#15162 - fixed thanks to Gabor 
        - Updated META.yml
        - added Test-CPAN-Meta to tests
        - reviewed other optional tests
        - abstracted footer template
        - added other websites to footer
        - reworked side panel for all pages, providing more presentation 
	  features
        - added Archive::Extract to unwrap the database
        - generate() no longer automatically downloads the database archive,
          as the current site is built from a local copy.
        - rewrote examples/generate.pl to allow remote or local database 
          locations to be used. Also updated documentation and version.
        - added bin/cpanreps-writepages, which is really a copy of
          examples/generate.pl
	- added 'nopass' RSS feed (patch by Dave E Wheeler RT#33946)
	- Author RSS feeds now list at most the last 100 reports
	- added links from author page to distribution pages (RT#22072)
	- added CSS and JS for optionally selecting viewing preferences
	- added a redirect page for directories without a main index
	- now builds author and distribution pages based on the actual version
	  of a distribution, not what BACKPAN currently lists. This was a 
	  problem where multiple authors released different versions of a 
	  distribution
	- added cpanreps-verify to verify pages contain the latest updates
	- added cpanreps-update to update named distribution and author pages
	- add functionality to Testers.pm to allow updates for named 
	  distributions and authors
	- discovered some distributions have "gone missing" from both CPAN and
	  BACKPAN, so the archive of reports is all we have! Appropriate code
	  changes made to ensure pages still built correctly.
	- added Perl Community AdServer links
	- consistently provided help|h and version|V options to all scripts:
	    bin/cpanreps-update     (v0.01)
	    bin/cpanreps-verify	    (v0.01)
	    bin/cpanreps-writepages (v0.02)
	- added some shortcuts to rebuilding author pages, including adding a 
	  GROUP BY so we don't try and query every report for the author.
	- better version sorting implemented, mostly for stats matrix
