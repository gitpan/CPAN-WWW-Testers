<h2>Become a tester</h2>

Whether you have a common platform or a very unusual one, you can help
by testing modules you install and submitting reports. There are plenty
of module authors who could use test reports and helpful feedback on their

<h3>History</h3>

The CPAN testers was conceived back in May 1998 by Graham Barr and 
Chris Nandor as a way to provide multi-platform testing for modules.
Today there are [% total_reports | comma %] tester reports and more than 400 testers 
giving valuable feedback for users and authors alike.
