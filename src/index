          <h2>Become a tester</h2>

          <p>Whether you have a common platform or a very unusual one, you can help by 
          testing modules you install and submitting reports. There are plenty of module
          authors who could use test reports and helpful feedback on their modules and 
          distributions. </p>

          <p>If you'd like to get involved, please take a look at the 
          <a href="http://wiki.cpantesters.org">CPAN Testers Wiki</a>, where you can 
          learn how to install and configure one of the recommended smoke tools.</p>

      <h3>History:</h3>
      <p>The CPAN testers was conceived back in May 1998 by Graham Barr and Chris Nandor
      as a way to provide multi-platform testing for modules. Today there are 
      [% total_reports | comma %] tester reports and more than 100 testers each month
      giving valuable feedback for users and authors alike.</p>
