NAME
    CPAN::WWW::Testers - The pre-2009 CPAN Testers website codebase.

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution used to generate the CPAN Testers Reports website before 
    2009.

CPAN TESTERS

    The CPAN Testers project was conceived back in May 1998 by Graham Barr and 
    Chris Nandor as a way to provide multi-platform testing for modules uploaded
    to CPAN. Today there are over 20 million test reports and more than 100 
    testers regularly submitting reports each month, giving valuable feedback 
    for users and authors alike.

    The objective of the group is to test as many of the distributions 
    available on CPAN as possible, on as many platforms as possible, with a 
    variety of perl interpreters. The ultimate goal is to improve the 
    portability of the distributions on CPAN, and provide good feedback to the 
    authors.

    This distribution used to create CPAN Testers website up until 2009. Leon 
    Brocard was the original author and maintainer of this distribution, which
    Barbie took over in 2008. Following the complete redesign of the website,
    and associated sites, this distribution and the tools used were no longer
    required.

    For the current set of releases for the CPAN Testers family of websites,
    please see:

    * CPAN-Testers-WWW-Reports
    * CPAN-Testers-WWW-Statistics
    * CPAN-Testers-WWW-Wiki
    * CPAN-Testers-WWW-Blog

    ADVANCED WARNING - ADVANCED WARNING - ADVANCED WARNING - ADVANCED WARNING

    This distribution will soon be deleted from CPAN. It is no longer
    applicable for the building of the CPAN Testers websites, and no longer
    maintained.

BECOME A TESTER
    The objective of the CPAN Testers is to test as many of the distributions 
    on CPAN as possible, on as many platforms as possible. The ultimate goal is
    to improve the portability of the distributions on CPAN, and provide good 
    feedback to the authors.

    Whether you have a common platform or a very unusual one, you can help by 
    testing modules you install and submitting reports. There are plenty of 
    module authors who could use test reports and helpful feedback on their 
    modules and distributions. 

    If you'd like to get involved, please take a look at the CPAN Testers Wiki,
    where you can learn how to install and configure one of the recommended 
    smoke tools.

    discussion mailing list.
