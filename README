NAME
    CPAN::WWW::Testers - Present CPAN Testers data

DESCRIPTION
    The distribution can present CPAN Testers data. cpan-testers is a group
    which was initially setup by Graham Barr and Chris Nandor. The objective
    of the group is to test as many of the distributions on CPAN as
    possible, on as many platforms as possible. The ultimate goal is to
    improve the portability of the distributions on CPAN, and provide good
    feedback to the authors.

    CPAN Testers is really a mailing list with a web interface,
    testers.cpan.org. testers.cpan.org was painfully slow. I happened to be
    doing metadata stuff for Module::CPANTS. This is the result. It's alpha
    code, but using it anyone can host their CPAN Testers website.

    Unpack the distribution and look at examples/generate.pl. Wait
    patiently. Send patches and better design.

    At the moment I am running the output of this at
    http://testers.astray.com/

INTERFACE
  The Constructor
    * new
        Instatiates the object CPAN::WWW::Testers.

  Methods
    *
    * directory
        Accessor to set/get the directory where the webpages are to be
        created. Note this also where the local copy of testers.db will
        reside.

    * generate

        SQLite database.

        Path to the SQLite database.

    * write
        Reads the local copy of the testers.db, and creates the alphabetic
        index, distribution and main index web pages, together with the YAML
        and RSS pages for each distribution.

    * make_rss
        Creates the RSS file for use by RSS readers.

Rewrite magic
    If you want to remain compatible with the URL scheme used on the old
    search.cpan.org, you can use the following mod_rewrite magic with Apache
    1 or 2:

      # Try and keep the same URL scheme as search.cpan.org:
      # This rewrites
      # /search?request=dist&dist=Cache-Mmap
      # to
      # /show/Cache-Mmap.html
      RewriteEngine On
      ReWriteRule ^/search$  /search_%{QUERY_STRING}
      RewriteRule   ^/search_request=dist&dist=(.*)$  /show/$1.html
