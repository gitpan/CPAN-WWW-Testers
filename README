NAME
    CPAN::WWW::Testers - Present CPAN Testers data

SYNOPSIS
      my $t = CPAN::WWW::Testers->new();
      $t->directory($directory);
      $t->generate;

DESCRIPTION
    The distribution can present CPAN Testers data. cpan-testers is a group
    which was initially setup by Graham Barr and Chris Nandor. The objective
    of the group is to test as many of the distributions on CPAN as
    possible, on as many platforms as possible. The ultimate goal is to
    improve the portability of the distributions on CPAN, and provide good
    feedback to the authors.

    CPAN Testers is really a mailing list with a web interface,
    testers.cpan.org. testers.cpan.org was painfully slow. I happened to be
    doing metadata stuff for Module::CPANTS. This is the result. It's alpha
    code, but using it anyone can host their CPAN Testers website.

    Unpack the distribution and look at examples/generate.pl. Wait
    patiently. Send patches and better design.

    At the moment I am running the output of this at
    http://testers.astray.com/
