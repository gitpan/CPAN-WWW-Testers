NAME
    CPAN::WWW::Testers - Download and present CPAN Testers data

DESCRIPTION
    The distribution can download and present CPAN Testers data.
    cpan-testers is a group which was initially setup by Graham Barr and
    Chris Nandor. The objective of the group is to test as many of the
    distributions on CPAN as possible, on as many platforms as possible. The
    ultimate goal is to improve the portability of the distributions on
    CPAN, and provide good feedback to the authors.

    CPAN Testers is really a mailing list with a web interface,
    testers.cpan.org. testers.cpan.org was painfully slow. I happened to be
    doing metadata stuff for Module::CPANTS. This is the result. It's alpha
    code, but using it anyone can host their CPAN Testers website.

    Unpack the distribution and look at examples/generate.pl. Wait
    patiently. Send patches and better design.

    At the moment I am running the output of this at
    http://testers.astray.com/
