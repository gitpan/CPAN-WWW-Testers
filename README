DESCRIPTION

    This distribution generates the CPAN Testers Reports website.

CPAN TESTERS

    cpan-testers is a group, that was originaly setup by Graham Barr and Chris
    Nandor.

    The objective of the group is to test as many of the distributions 
    available on CPAN as possible, on as many platforms as possible, with a 
    variety of perl interpreters. The ultimate goal is to improve the 
    portability of the distributions on CPAN, and provide good feedback to the 
    authors.

    CPAN Testers began as a mailing list with a web interface (see the NNTP
    website - http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/). Leon Brocard 
    began working on extracting metadata for use with the CPANTS, and ended up
    creating the Reports website. This code now allows you to create and host 
    your very own CPAN Testers website, should you so choose.

    Unpack the distribution and look at examples/generate.pl, to understand how
    the site is generated. If you would like to send patches or report bugs,
    please use the RT system.
